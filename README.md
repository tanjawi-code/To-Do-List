<h1>To-Do List Project</h1>

<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>This is a normal project to improve myself in creating projects that use both forntend and backend.</p>
<p>This project is going to be focused more on backend, and in forntend I will only use <b>Vanilla JS</b> to handle requests and responses.</p>
<p>I am going to use different technologies in backend and keep developing the project.</p>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Creating lists (each list has different tasks).</li>
    <li>A database (MongoDB).</li>
    <li>JWT for securing APIs.</li>
    <li>A task details (date and details of the task).</li>
    <li>Login Page.</li>
</ul>
